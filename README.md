# war-hello
Hello, World application for Java EE, JBoss EAP, and Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes

To compile and run locally, you need the Red Hat Maven repositories. A sample Maven settings.xml file is provided in the conf folder.

WIP: DO NOT CLONE YET!

XXX it looks like I need additional build-env so the eap s2i builder skips the FMP
